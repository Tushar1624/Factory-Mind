# 🏭 Factory Mind

An AI-powered Predictive Maintenance System that uses Machine Learning to predict potential machine failures before they occur, helping reduce downtime, improve operational efficiency, and support proactive maintenance decisions.

## 🚀 Live Demo

**Application:** https://factory-mind.onrender.com/

**Source Code:** https://github.com/Tushar1624/Factory-Mind

Data Cleaning
   ↓
Feature Selection
   ↓
Feature Scaling
   ↓
Random Forest Training
   ↓
Model Serialization
   ↓
Streamlit Deployment
```

---

# 🔄 Retraining the Model

If you want to retrain the machine learning model using the dataset:

## Run Data Preprocessing

```bash
python src/data_preprocessing.py
```

## Train the Model

```bash
python src/train_model.py
```

After training, new model files will be generated inside:

```text
models/
```
